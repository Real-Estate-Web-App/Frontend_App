This project implements the frontend part of the online 
real estate platform. The app allows two types of users,
clients and real estate agent, each of them having different
functionalities available. The clients can create an account,
view and manage their profile data, and make an appointment
on the rent page to visit a building. The real estate agent
can add buildings to the database, delete them, and edit their
details in the rent page.
The `rent` page is the functional one, the `for sale` page is
a dummy one, that can be developed in the future. Each building
has to be selected individually from its card, and then an
action can be performed on it.

The framework used to develop the application is ReactJS.

### `npm install`
